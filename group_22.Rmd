### Brief description

A shiny app can be rapidly deployed by an R-developer in a matter of a few hours. Shiny high-level app elements are controlled through layout functions and complex and multi-page layouts are easily possible. Shiny is built on Bootstrap, but Bootstrap knowledge is not required to create UIs in shiny. There is a bit of flexibility to create additional Bootstrap, HTML, CSS components that are not contained in shiny, and a number of JavaScript events are also supported.

### Long description

There are a number of resources available to walk users through basic shiny layouts.

A shiny app can be rapidly deployed by an R-developer in a matter of a few hours. Shiny high-level app elements are controlled through layout functions and complex and multi-page layouts are easily possible. 

Shiny is built on Bootstrap, but Bootstrap knowledge is not required to create UIs in shiny. There is flexibility to create Bootstrap components that are not contained in shiny through “utility classes.” Customization is possible through the addition of CSS or HTML code, events can be managed with JavaScript, and there are also a number of extensions available for shiny on GitHub.

The layout is controlled by layout functions that control high-level elements of the page. Complex pages are possible utilizing multi-column and row formatting. Multi-page layouts are possible through the use of tabsets, navlists and/or navbars. Shiny also supports responsive layout through Bootstrap, so the app can adapt its grid system to various devices.

In general, the layout could be heavily customized in a very comprehensive and simple way.
