### Brief description

Dash is new in the Python ecosystem which was first introduced in 2017. It is a free Python library for creating reactive, web-based applications. This document is to give users an extensive list of resources to learn Dash. The list is composed of three main parts of resources, namely `Introduction to Dash`, `Tutorials`, and `Public curated resources`.


### Long description

Dash is an open source library for creating reactive, web-based applications, which was released under the permissive MIT license.
In 2017 Plotly launched the initial beta version of Dash, with the frameworkâ€™s initial release coming in early 2019. In 2019 Dash for R was created, and in 2020 Dash for Julia was created, leading to a language-agnostic framework built upon the most common data science programming languages.
Developing web application in Dash is straight forward as its uses Python programming as its base and it is made on python flask framework.
Those who use Python for data analysis, data exploration, visualization, modelling, instrument control, and reporting will find immediate use for Dash. This document is to give users an extensive list of resources to learn Dash. 

To get to know Dash better as a newbie, the following tutorials and articles can generalize what it is all about from basic level to a high-level. Firstly, it is suggested that beginners should start with some resources about `Introduction to Dash`. Youtube is a great resources since it contains short videos with good contents without making the new learners feeling overwhelmed. Once getting used to the basic idea of Dash, it is a good time to move forward with more advanced `Tutorials` to dig deeper into each specific topics of Dash. Again, the `Dash Plottly Channel` on Youtube is a very good resource. During the process of working with Dash, if learners encounter any obstacles, Dash communities and other resources under `Public curated resources` are very useful.
