## Tableau - Frontend
### Brief description

Tableau is a standalone application of its own, and no coding is involved for the frontend layout. The GUI design consists of dragging and dropping pre-built chart objects and mapping the features to the axes and legend. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that it is possible to use bootstrap with Tableau. There are several layout techniques within Tableau. There are options such as size, floating, tiled and containers. The user can easily customize the size of the dashboard by choosing a fixed, range or automatic sizing. Furthermore, the user can easily customize between a tiled or floating (or combination of both) dashboard. A floating object can be layered on top of the other objects which can have a fixed size and position, whereas a tiled object is organized in a single layer which adjusts in size given the dashboard size and the surrounding objects. Furthermore, the user can customize the containers which are dashboard objects that contain other objects, and they can be customized to be horizontal or vertical. Overall, using Tableau, the users can customize complex layout designs which are easy to learn, fast to deploy and intuitive.

Tableau is a standalone application of its own, and no coding is involved for the frontend layout. The GUI design consists of dragging and dropping pre-built chart objects and mapping the features to the axes and legend. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that it is possible to use bootstrap with Tableau. For instance, [this app](https://github.com/edocbuhtig/svelte-tableau-bootstrap) has been developed using Tableau with the integration of Bootstrap 5 library.

There are several layout techniques within Tableau. There are options such as size, floating, tiled and containers. When sizing the dashboard, the user can use 3 different options such as fixed, range and automatic sizing. In addition to sizing, the user can use a tiled or floating (or combination of both) dashboard. A floating object can be layered on top of the other objects which can have a fixed size and position, whereas a tiled object is organized in a single layer which adjusts in size given the dashboard size and the surrounding objects. Furthermore, the user can customize the containers which are dashboard objects that contain other objects, and they can be customized to be horizontal or vertical.

Overall, Tableau is very easy to learn, fast to deploy and intuitive to the user. There are many guides online that explain and walk the user through the steps to create and customize complex layout designs.
