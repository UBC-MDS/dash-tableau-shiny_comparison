### Long description

#### When was it created?

Dash was created and released in 2017 as a Python library.

#### Are other companies involved in the current development of this technology?

`Plotly` is a Canada-based company which built Dash and supports its current development until now. `Plotly`, as the company, open-sourced Dash and released it under an MIT license, so people can use Dash for free.

There is also a commercial companion that is shared by `Plotly` called `Dash Enterprise`. This service provides companies with support services including hosting, deploying, and handling authentication on Dash applications for certain amount of costs. But these features do not belong to Dashâ€™s open source ecosystem.

Additionally, in order to build the user interface layer of Python, R and Julia, Dash teamed up with friends at `Formidable` which is known for world-class React application development and tooling. 

#### Is possible to be used with different languages.

Yes, Dash has grown to include implementations for other languages like `R` and `Julia` and F# (only experimental) which makes it much easier for data scientists to build analytically web applications without requiring advanced web development knowledge and coding skills. 

#### Since when?

It starts to be used with different languages like `R` since 2019 and `Julia` since 2020.
